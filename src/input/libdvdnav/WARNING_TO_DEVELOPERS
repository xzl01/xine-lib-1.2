./xine-lib/src/input/libdvdnav.
This part of the tree should never be modified directly.
The entire libdvdnav directory is periodically updated from dvd.sf.net libdvdnav cvs.
If any developers notice a bug in this code, please report it to the dvd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
If any developers have any patches for this code, please report it to the dvd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
The dvd.sf.net libdvdnav cvs will then be updated, and xine-lib will receive the update when the next periodic update from dvd.sf.net libdvdnav cvs happens.

If one uses the following command in ./xine-lib directory, One can bypass this code, and force xine-lib to use the dvd.sf.net libdvdnav cvs code directly, thus simplifying the developers testing of bug fixes/new features in libdvdnav.

./configure --with-external-dvdnav

Thank you for your understanding.
